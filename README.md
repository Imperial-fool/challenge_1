This is pretty much my first forey into dart and flutter I have gone in without any prior knowledge and have attempted to recreated this first challenge without any instruction... it works but with some probably unsafe methods i used a global file to store state across pages instead of using any sort of provider since it was faster/easier

this has been tested on pixel 3a emulation, ios iphone 13 emulation and a samsung s20 fe, they all work except there are some visual bugs on each of them. the ios emulation also has some sort of weird issue where to use the slider it must be pixel perfect and i mean pixel perfect move the mouse a tiny bit and it just stops.

virutal android was running api 32 and ended using 6.9 gb of disk space after all was said and dont, obviously not the most efficient thing in the world.
